# _Hextris_ - A fast paced HTML5 game inspired by Tetris!

## Project Description
Hextris is a fast-paced, easy to play browser game, that can also be played on mobile devices such as tablet and smartphone.
The goal of the game, much like Tetris, is to not let the colored blocks reach the critical height, outlined by a gray hexagon.
As the game goes on, the colored blocks start to fall from the outer edge of the hexagon. Upon reaching the darker hexagon or another piece (of any color) they stick to it, remaining there in a stack.
The player may chose to rotate the hexagon (and all the blocks attached to it) using the arrow keys, to manipulate where the next blocks will fall.
Placing three or more blocks of the same color clears them from the game area, scoring points for the player, sliding down the blocks above them, and effectively continuing the game. Clearing series of blocks grants a combo, which increases multiplicatively the score you would normally get from doing this.

On the mobile versions of the game, you control the hexagon by tapping left or right on the screen. Additionally, tapping on the center of the darker hexagon toggles speeding up the game.

Hextris was created using Javascript and HTML5 Canvas, and was inspired by the classic game of _Tetris_ and _QbQbQb_.
